# Effects of various factors on Seattle Airbnb prices
## Project overview:-
The purpose of this project is to investigate host listings on Airbnb, a popular online hospitality service marketplace, to build predictive models on listing price based on key factors and variables.This information will allow Airbnb hosts to find and improve certain variables of their listing that are the highest indicators when it comes to setting price. Our predictive model can provide rough estimates as to how much your Airbnb in Seattle should be listed at based on your listing criteria.

## Resources Used
Python Version: 3.8.3
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Data
There are three categories of datasets utilized in this project. listing.csv, calendar.csv and reviews.csv

## Summary
This project follows CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Steps followed in this project:

* Analyze the price, how can you predict , discuss how price can contribute to neighborhood , factors that influence prices(does the number of bedrooms and guest included
  contribute to price), how price vary for property type and what guests say about their experience with Airbnb.
* Applied certain data cleaning and wrangling techniques, handled missing data, impute where necessary, removed the outliers, and perform some text preprocessing.
* Answer questions by using appropriate aggregate method following statistical standards.
* Present the result of the analysis in form of tables and graphs.

For this project data used Seattle Airbnb data. Jupyter notebook incuded in the project where the code is written. The data cleaning and preparation is performed in the [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/AnnieThomas02/DS-CRISP-DM/blob/master/Data-Cleaning.ipynb). All of the data exploration, model training, parameter selection, and analysis is performed in the [Price Analysis](https://github.com/AnnieThomas02/DS-CRISP-DM/blob/master/price-analysis.ipynb). I also wrote a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@anniemathewlog/relationship-between-seattle-airbnb-prices-and-other-determinants-277cacda1bd6?sk=564477f9c0284d4ef6b21e0fb1f58d7a) about this project.
