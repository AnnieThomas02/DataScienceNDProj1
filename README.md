# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project 1
## Price Prediction Using AirBnB Data

![alt text](./title_image.jpg)

The goals of this project are to: 

1. Pick a dataset.

2. Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3. Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

  * Prepare data:

    * Gather necessary data to answer your questions
    * Handle categorical and missing data
    * Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them

  * Analyze, Model, and Visualize

    * Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.

4. Communicate your business insights:

  * Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
  * Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

For my project I used Seattle Airbnb data. The code is all contained in the Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/alangordon258/DataScienceNDProj1/blob/master/airbnbanalysis.ipynb) incuded in the project. Simply clone this project into a directory and then download the Airbnb Seattle data and add the three csv files to a sub-directory named "seattle". I also wrote a Medium post about this project which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@alan_a_gordon/on-tribe-called-quest-and-the-price-of-airbnb-listings-in-seattle-854e672a55aa).
